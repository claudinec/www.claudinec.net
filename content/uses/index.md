title: What I use
draft: true

Lists of things I use daily/frequently. Longer explanations may come later.

## Hardware

General principles: Unix-like servers, personal devices from the Appleverse. This is where I've landed after learning programming and system administration in Unix environments and later working with history professors and web designers who care about things looking nice. I work in a bring-your-own-device environment, so I only occasionally have to use Windows.

- everyday devices: MacBook Air, iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad Pro
- home servers: Mac Mini, Raspberry Pi
- hosted elsewhere: NearlyFreeSpeech shared hosting for DIY enthusiasts, which allows me to tinker with my static website without the overkill of a cloud VPS

## Software

- programming and, for want of a better term, "personal devops"
    - Tailscale connects all my devices in a VPN
    - most code and config are kept in git repositories which live in Gitolite at home and, in some cases, also on GitHub
    - after decades in bash and many years in zsh, I've been using fish as my primary shell since mid-2023
    - tmux plays nicely with both iTerm2 (macOS) and Secure Shellfish (iOS)
    - dotfiles managed by chezmoi (still in the process of migrating from dotbot)
    - Python is my go-to scripting language for most tasks that don't interact with the web
    - vanilla JavaScript for working with web data and APIs, and with iOS automation utilities
    - Hugo static site generator
- macOS
    - dev tools: Homebrew, iTerm2, MacVim, Visual Studio Code
    - personal automation: Shortcuts, Keyboard Maestro, Bunch, Drafts
    - Microsoft Office to collaborate with work colleagues
- iOS/iPadOS
    - automation superpowers: Shortcuts, Pushcut, Scriptable, Drafts
    - dev tools: Secure Shellfish, a-Shell, Working Copy, Textastic, Runestone
- fun/downtime (iOS/macOS)
    - NetNewsWire RSS reader (self-curated chronological feeds)
    - Ivory for Mastodon
    - Triode internet radio
