Hi, I'm Claudine Chionh. My pronouns are [she/her/hers](https://pronouns.within.lgbt/she/her). My family name is pronounced (from the Hokkien) [/tÕ°…ïi…î≈ã‚Åµ¬≥/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ëî£#Pronunciation_1) ("Chiong") but I'll answer to anything that comes close.[^chionh]

[^chionh]: "Chionh" is a bad romanisation of [Ji«éng (Ëíã)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C7%8Eng_(surname)) ‚Äì family lore says that the misspelling was introduced by a British colonial clerk.

### :iphone: Phone

**TL;DR: Please don't call me without advance warning, send me a text.** iMessage, Signal, and SMS are all fine with me.

If you're fortunate enough to have my phone number, you already know at least some of these facts about me: I'm highly introverted, I value having written records of important communications, I make extensive use of Do-Not-Disturb and [Focus Filters](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/iphone/iphd6288a67f/ios) to regulate real-time notifications, and I'd rather force-feed pills to an angry cat than answer unscheduled phone calls.

I do regularly *schedule* phone calls as an alternative to face-to-face meetings and hangouts, but unscheduled calls mostly fall into one of three categories for me: genuinely critical emergencies; calls of the type "I'm here at our meeting place, where are you?"; and spam.

**Voicemail PSA:** Vodafone Australia will notify me of missed calls immediately, but voicemail messages could take up to a few days to arrive! If you call me and I don't answer, just hang up and send me a text.

Of course, in the unlikely circumstance that you have my phone number but you don't have a mobile phone, only a landline, by all means call my number and leave me a voicemail.[^noputer]

[^noputer]: And if you can access this page on the web but can't send me an email ... actually, I would be really interested in learning about edge cases like this.
