Hi, I'm Claudine Chionh. My pronouns are [she/her/hers](https://pronouns.within.lgbt/she/her). My family name is pronounced (from the Hokkien) [/tÕ°…ïi…î≈ã‚Åµ¬≥/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ëî£#Pronunciation_1) ("Chiong") but I'll answer to anything that comes close.[^chionh]

[^chionh]: "Chionh" is a bad romanisation of [Ji«éng (Ëíã)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C7%8Eng_(surname)) ‚Äì family lore says that the misspelling was introduced by a British colonial clerk.
