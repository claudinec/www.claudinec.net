Hi, I'm Claudine Chionh. My pronouns are [she/her/hers](https://pronouns.within.lgbt/she/her). My family name is pronounced (from the Hokkien) [/tÕ°…ïi…î≈ã‚Åµ¬≥/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ëî£#Pronunciation_1) ("Chiong") but I'll answer to anything that comes close.[^chionh]

[^chionh]: "Chionh" is a bad romanisation of [Ji«éng (Ëíã)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C7%8Eng_(surname)) ‚Äì family lore says that the misspelling was introduced by a British colonial clerk.

## Contact me

### :email: Email

**If you already have my email address at this domain, keep using that one**, otherwise you can email me at [hello+www@claudinec.net](mailto:hello+www@claudinec.net). On this website, the "Email me about this page" link at the top of a page will pre-fill the subject field in your email client.

I prefer [plain text email](https://useplaintext.email/), but am forgiving of those who don't know how to enable it. Big Tech makes it difficult for regular users to adhere to long-lived email standards.

### :iphone: Phone

**Please don't call me without advance warning; send me a text.** iMessage, Signal, and SMS are all fine with me.

### :rainbow_flag: Work-related
