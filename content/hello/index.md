## How to refer to me

Hi, I'm Claudine Chionh. My pronouns are [she/her/hers](https://pronouns.within.lgbt/she/her). My family name is pronounced (from the Hokkien) [/t͡ɕiɔŋ⁵³/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/蔣#Pronunciation_1) ("Chiong") but I'll answer to anything that comes close. "Chionh" is a bad romanisation of [Jiǎng (蒋)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C7%8Eng_(surname)) – family lore says that the misspelling was introduced by a British colonial clerk.
