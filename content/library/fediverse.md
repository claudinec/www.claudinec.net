## Incomplete list of regional and topical Mastodon servers that seem decent

If you want to try Mastodon, I can't tell you which server is right for you, but I frequently follow or interact with members of the following servers so I think they're worth considering. Each server's **About** page has information about its ethos, rules/code of conduct, and prohibited content.

These arbitrary sub-headings of mine are not necessarily defining characteristics or rules for exclusion, just a very rough description of the kinds of people who tend to hang out on each server. There are also broader lists of general-interest and special-interest servers at [Fedi.Garden](https://fedi.garden/) (brought to you by Fedi.Tips) and [Join Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/servers).

Remember: **Federation** means you can interact with people on other servers without needing a separate account on each server. (Just like email!) And if you do find a friendly home, consider chipping in to help with the costs of operating a server.
