I write about technology and society and their intersections. I am particularly interested in the history of computing and the early web, and the impacts of technology on marginalised communities. Iâ€™m not an outside observer: I have worked as a data analyst, web developer, and technology consultant since the late 1990s, and am involved in communities and organisations that aim to make the technology industry more progressive.
