I am seeking opportunities to develop as a writer while drawing on my professional experience in medical and social research, web development, and political campaigning. My writing experience has comprised internal technical documentation and training, postgraduate-level research papers, and book reviews. I am exploring further directions for writing, including technical writing, social and policy research, and literary non-fiction.
