## What's a feed?

A web feed[^rss] is a stream, river, or firehose[^metaphors] of content on a whole website, website section, or social profile, (usually) ordered chronologically, which you can follow alongside other feeds in the feed reader of your choice. So, instead of starting your lunch break by opening a web browser and clicking your bookmarks for your twenty favourite websites (not that there's anything wrong with that), you can open your feed reader to see what those twenty (or 200, or 2,000) sites have posted or updated since your last visit.

[^rss]: You may also see **RSS** (a file format) used interchangeably with **feed**, though nowadays feeds are often in Atom or even JSON format as well.

[^metaphors]: I'll stop using other people's aquatic metaphors now.

If you're younger than me or spend much of your online life inside corporate walled gardens, you may be thinking of [*algorithmic* feeds](https://indieweb.org/algorithmic_feed), which use opaque, machine-driven formulae to determine what you see on a social media platform. The original web feeds – independent, interoperable, and still thriving – are the opposite of algorithmic feeds: creators decide what goes into their feeds, and you decide which feeds to consume and when.[^feedrant]

[^feedrant]: [:mammoth: Me ranting about this in January 2024.](https://aus.social/@claudinec/111793840021907927) I can't even remember what provoked this rant.

## Is there an app for that?

You'll need a **feed reader**, which could be a (Free/Libre/Open Source, freeware, or paid) software client on your smartphone, tablet, or computer, or a web application hosted on a server that you own and control, or on someone else's web server (which you might need to pay to use).

[**About Feeds**](https://aboutfeeds.com/#2-how-do-i-get-a-newsreader-app) has a short list of popular feed readers. The [**Mac Open Web**](https://macopenweb.com/) directory has a comprehensive list of feed readers for macOS and iOS.
