This post started as a follow-up to related posts on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Netrider, but grew too long for those venues. <!--more--> A little over three weeks ago I posted enthusiastically about my upcoming motorcycle learner permit course. Bottom line: I was not in good mental shape before the course started and I only completed the first half of the first day, before I got to any of the assessments. I'm hoping to return after summer when I am refreshed and relatively relaxed.

My sleep hygiene usually degrades over the course of a calendar year due to the rapidly growing pile of work obligations and my reluctance to take holidays. It's also been getting worse since 2020 as every year brings a new variation on generalised public health anxiety. In addition, my partner had tested positive for COVID-19 the day before the course started. I was tired and anxious at a deeply existential level.

As I had done on a pre-learner course a few weeks earlier, I rode a 125cc scooter while the rest of the group rode motorcycles. The group's prior motorcycling experience ranged from a two-hour pre-learner course (me) to off-road riders and road riders who were repeating the course (the Victorian motorcycle learner permit cannot be renewed). Or, to put it another way, the group comprised four hotheaded young men and me, a new rider with baseline general anxiety.

The instructor observed that I was picking up skills but my brain was constantly getting in the way, preventing me from increasing speed or really leaning in to turns. I didn't look at the speedometer at all but I feel that I barely went over an average bicycle speed. By lunchtime the temperature and UV index were climbing (did I mention I'm not a summer person?) and I knew my brain and mood were not making me the best rider I could be on the day.

The instructor and [school](https://www.armstrongsdrivereducation.com.au/motorcycle-courses.php) were kind and understanding and will let me rebook the course at a later date at no extra charge. A good night's sleep really helped me work through the day's (life and bike) lessons so I can make a more realistic plan for getting back on the bike.

1. I have done a lot of book-learning and enjoy acquiring knowledge and brain skills like human and computer languages. I drastically underestimated the challenges in learning new physical and machine-oriented skills. I know I can do this; I just can't expect to be road-ready after twelve hours.

2. The [VicRoads motorcycle training structure](https://transport.vic.gov.au/Registration-and-licensing/Licences/Motorcycle-licence/Get-your-motorcycle-Ls) doesn't suit the way I learn, so I'll have to find additional ways to support my learning. I have been following Daan Berg's blog about [learning motorcycling in the Netherlands](https://daanberg.net/en/category/personal/motorcycle-en/) and also looking back at the [car driving practice](https://transport.vic.gov.au/Registration-and-licensing/Licences/Probationary-licence/Prepare-for-your-probationary-licence) that VicRoads requires of young learner drivers. An intensive two-day course on new skills *and* roadcraft is in no way comparable to a multi-stage course spread out over a few months, or 120 hours' supervised driving practice. I rarely pick up new physical or mechanical skills on the first try, but I can get there with repeated practice in a low-stress environment (i.e., not with four young hotheads whizzing around me). I also know that my brain does a great job of processing lessons overnight so that I can evaluate them dispassionately the next day &ndash; so a course over two consecutive days is not enough.

3. A one-size-fits-all pedagogy is not optimised for an inexperienced middle-aged rider who never got around to taking a car driving test but regularly rode a bicycle until the pandemic. An instructor or mentor who forgoes the car analogies and can talk about how motorcycle riding is and is not like bicycle riding would really help me translate my bicycle skills.

I'm already committed enough to have bought [All The Gear](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ATGATT) except for a helmet.[^gear] I naïvely thought that I could get my learner's in December and get some solid practice in the January slow period, but really I should have know that the accumulation of life stress and the onset of summer makes December a bad time for me to try to learn new skills or take on any new commitments. I won't be re-enrolling until summer is over, to minimise the risk of trying to learn on a hot day. What I might end up doing over January and February is spending more time on the bicycle and really *thinking* about this skill that I have been practising without thinking for nearly forty years; and booking some one-on-one practice time at the motorcycle school so that the official course becomes a consolidation and assessment of skills that I have already practised in ways that suit how I learn.

[^gear]: I don't have an unusually sized or shaped head and I knew that the 'Small' helmets used by the school fit me, but I have trouble finding gloves, jackets, and trousers that fit even before considering safety.
