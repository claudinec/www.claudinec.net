James posted his [decision tree](https://jamesg.blog/2024/03/30/coffee-to-drink-decision-tree/) for deciding what coffee to drink. I thought that as a strictly-black-coffee drinker mine would be simpler, but turns out there are still a few deciding factors.[^thread]

[^thread]: [Discussion on Mastodon :mammoth:](https://aus.social/@claudinec/112187405907379141)

The [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/products/aeropress-coffee-maker) (with [Prismo](https://fellowproducts.com/products/prismo)) has become my fuss-free almost-foolproof method for making that first cup of the day before I can concentrate on more precise methods. I can also make coffee for two by brewing into a carafe and adding extra hot water.

The [cafe](https://pridecentre.org.au/tenants/the-little-social/) in my work building didn't open until a year after ordinary Melburnians were allowed back into offices (and 18 months after the building officially opened). I was given a [Nanopresso](https://www.wacaco.com/products/nanopresso) to tide me over until then, and I still bring it in to work when I want a specific bean that I have at home or if I feel I'm spending too much money at cafes. A Nanopresso doesn't make espresso, strictly defined (it isn't possible to generate 9bar of pressure) but it's a neat little kit that I can pre-load with one or two shots in the morning and just add hot water from the office kitchen.

Specialty filter coffee is still pretty rare in Melbourne cafe culture and I've only been using a [V60](https://global.hario.com/product/coffee/dripper/VDC.html) dripper at home for about a year. I'm more likely to use this for a light and gentle pick-me-up in the afternoon.

Like most Melbourne households we have multiple Moka pots and plungers (French press) but I have hardly ever used these since discovering the AeroPress and fallling down the specialty coffee rabbit hole a few years ago. They're still good for making coffee for more than two people at a time.
