I love this footer that [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com) has started adding to the bottom of his posts:

The [old](https://www.anildash.com//2022/04/13/a-web-renaissance/), [weird](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/), [indie](https://indieweb.org/) web [never went away](https://www.citationneeded.news/we-can-have-a-different-web/). [RSS](https://aboutfeeds.com/) never went away, and neither did its friend Atom. [Blogrolls](https://blogroll.org/) and [directories](https://ooh.directory/) are re-emerging as alternatives to search engines for discovering websites that won't play the SEO game.

This isn't just Generation X nostalgia. Yes, my feed reader and [Mastodon](https://aus.social/@claudinec) timeline do seem to skew towards my generation, but as I've been spending more time with the [IndieWeb community](https://indieweb.org/discuss) I've been observing younger enthusiasts who are eager to build modern alternatives to Big Tech. There are plenty of technologists and metadata nerds who are bringing contemporary standards and best practices around [accessibility](https://indieweb.org/accessibility) and [semantic and linked data](http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page) to the DIY ethos of the old web. But there are also plenty of website builders who are here to revive the [creative, colourful web](https://home.omg.lol/) of the [GeoCities](https://neocities.org/) era.

The old web never went away, and it remains open to everyone. [Come and join us!](https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started)
