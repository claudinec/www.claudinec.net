:scroll: [**Signed the open letter to the Wikimedia Foundation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:2024_open_letter_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation) urging it not to dox editors who have annoyed an Indian news publisher.[^wtf-wmf]

[^wtf-wmf]: Yes, I decided in 2001 that I would use my real name as my Wikipedia/Wikimedia username, knowing that I might later regret this decision. Half my lifetime later, I still don't regret this and it's far too late to erase my identity, but I do recognise that it's become more risky.

:file_cabinet: Bought an additional hard drive to add to my DIY NAS and [**ArchiveBox**](https://archivebox.io/) setup at home.

:money_with_wings: Asked the [**Internet Archive**](https://archive.org/donate) to double my monthly donation.

:money_with_wings: Activated a [**paid subscription for Sourcehut git hosting**](https://man.sr.ht/billing-faq.md) (I've been freeloading for months but they haven't been nagging me as they're still in alpha).

:earth_asia: Read a lot of thoughts from IndieWeb-adjacent bloggers, including [**Baldur Bjarnason**](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/plan-b-it-is/) on the other side of the world:

> It’s a fact of life that those of us living in a satrapy or principality of the US empire have to suffer many of the consequences of US politics without having any say in them.

> But, even beyond that, anybody working in tech is directly affected by the changing winds of politics as complete deregulation is first plank in the tech industry’s two-plank strategy for postponing its inevitable decline.

It's all I can do to not feel helpless.
