I've been using `sh` or one of its variants (`bash` or `zsh`) since 1994 and I still find its syntax weird, especially when I spend most of my programming time in languages descended from C. [^ugh] So I mostly use shell as a launchpad for terminal programs and haven't really learned how to get the most out of shell as a scripting language in its own right.

[^ugh]: This is a common complaint, e.g. [tweet by @vamchale](https://twitter.com/vamchale/status/1190665410695376896) via [Oilshell](https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html).
