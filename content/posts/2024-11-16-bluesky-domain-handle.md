If you have your own domain, you can [use it as a handle for your Bluesky account](https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial) instead of the default `<username>.bsky.social`. Prior to today, my two posts on Bluesky were to whinge that (1) you still have to initially create an account on `bsky.app` and get assigned handle on the default domain before you can change it and (2) if you change the handle to your own domain, your original handle becomes available for someone else to claim, which isn't great for maintaining a persistent online identity.

Howver, [Jessica](https://www.jayeless.net/) [noted](https://bsky.app/profile/jayeless.net/post/3lazefacm6k2y) that it wouldn't be such a big deal to change a handle early or before interacting with others, so I went ahead and changed mine to [`@claudinec.net`](https://bsky.app/profile/claudinec.net). It only took a few minutes to initiate the change in the Bluesky settings, add the provided DNS record (a single TXT record) in my DNS manager, and verify the change in the Bluesky settings. I will begrudgingly admit that Bluesky do seem to be making adoption easy for new technical and non-technical users alike.
