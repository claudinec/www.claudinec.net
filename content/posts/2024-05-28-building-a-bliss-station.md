Stress, burnout

Going analogue

Austin Kleon / Joseph Campbell: [bliss station](https://austinkleon.com/2016/07/21/the-bliss-station/)

Virginia Woolf: [a room of one's own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_of_One%27s_Own) (for well-off white women)

If not a room, at least a space *or* a time

Kleon: 'Disconnect from the world to connect to yourself.' (_Keep Going_, pp. 38ff.)

Station: 'hot' corner of my desk

Tools: paper and pencil; analogue musical instruments

Time: work in progress
