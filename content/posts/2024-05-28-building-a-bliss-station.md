I have experienced constant stress, anxiety, and associated neck and shoulder pain for most of my adult life. The events of the last four years – moving in and out of pandemic mode, watching my world collectively take on more stress, anxiety, and rage in response to wars of all kinds – brought with them a flare-up of my own physical and mental pain. At the start of March I took stock of the habits and routines I had developed and started experimenting with various ways of turning down the noise of the external world.

For inspiration, I reread [*Keep Going*](https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/) by Austin Kleon, and kept returning to his chapter: 'Build a [bliss station](https://austinkleon.com/2016/07/21/the-bliss-station/)'. The concept isn't new – I was reminded of Virginia Woolf's musings on access to [a room of one's own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_of_One%27s_Own). Kleon himself quotes Joseph Campbell in his introduction to the bliss station:

> You must have a room, or a certain hour or so a day, where you don’t know what was in the newspapers that morning, you don’t know who your friends are, you don’t know what you owe anybody, you don’t know what anybody owes to you. This is a place where you can simply experience and bring forth what you are and what you might be. This is the place of creative incubation.

The goal is to 'Disconnect from the world to connect to yourself.'[^disconnect] If I can't always have a place *or* a time, I can still build a bliss 'station' from my tools or working environment.

[^disconnect]: Austin Kleon, _Keep Going_, pp. 38ff.

I started trying to make a habit of disconnecting by setting personal rules for reducing screen time (Apple's aptly named [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-au/108806) feature is great for this) and online time. My rules have sometimes been challenging and I am continuously adjusting them, but in general, I am more frequently locking myself out of my digital devices intentionally, switching to [aeroplane mode](https://support.apple.com/en-au/108785), or switching them off altogether. Instead, I am writing a lot more, often starting with pencil on paper.[^delay] I have indulged in enjoyable-but-affordable stationery since I was a teenager. A blank page will always be a little intimidating, but I am still more likely to complete journal entries or blog posts that I start on paper, away from the distractions and 'at-work' mindset of a computer screen.

[^delay]: In fact, I wrote this post in my notebook three days ago and delayed publishing it because I just didn't feel like sitting at a computer long enough to type it up.

A few days ago I [posted](/posts/2024-05-25-a-week-off) a photo of two small synthesisers on my desk. I have not settled on a musical bliss station yet. I got the little Volca partly with the idea that I might make music on my long commute to or from work but I haven't got into the habit of adding it to my work bag yet. I have music software on my iPad and Mac but it's so easy to get overwhelmed by all the possibilities offered by software. Taking my reading and writing analogue-first has been great for my wellbeing. Maybe I will benefit from embracing these constraints in music as well.
