I have enabled [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/) on my iPad Pro and MacBook Air now that it's available in Australian English, because I am an Information Professional and want to be able to give informed advice to colleagues and family members if they ask about it.

GOOD: Apple Intelligence is off by default.

GOOD: I can enable notification summaries on a per-app basis.

GOOD: I haven't seen any examples of summaries making the kinds of terrible misinterpretation that have been reported elsewhere. Maybe some kinks have been ironed out.

MEH: Summaries of email threads (group discussions or listservs) are so high-level they're almost pointless. These threads go into a lot of technical or operational detail that can't be summarised in three sentences.

GOOD: I can now type queries to Siri instead of talking. That's one affordance that the pivot to chatbots has encouraged.

GOOD: ChatGPT integration is off by default and can be used without an OpenAI account. I can  require a warning from Siri if my query cannot be answered on-device and needs to be sent to ChatGPT. Hopefully I get this warning every time (i.e. it's not an 'Allow always' switch).

MEH: I can connect Apple Intelligence to my OpenAI account. This would be useful if I had a paid account or access to more models, which I don't.

GOOD: If I send a query to ChatGPT, the response includes a link to the query on the ChatGPT website so I can continue the 'conversation' (I don't know if this works without an OpenAI account).

ADDENDUM, MEH: This is more a criticism of ChatGPT. As work has been busy I haven't kept up with James Hoffmann's decaf project. My initial query and two followup requests resulted in [three lists of six videos](https://chatgpt.com/share/67661c37-0b5c-800c-9ff1-a04fdf202c43), overlapping but not identical. I wanted the same results, with additional formatting requests. I'm also not confident that I have all the results I wanted. But I really haven't spent much time trying to make ChatGPT work for me.
