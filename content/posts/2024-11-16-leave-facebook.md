I still have friends and family whose online social experience is only on Facebook and its cousins. I periodically post reminders there to say that I'm not active on Facebook and my [Hello page](/hello) here always has my current contact details. In the spirit of [PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) (Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate on Own Site), here's a copy of my most recent reminder post.

> Periodic reminder that I'm not really here on this hellsite and you can contact/connect with me through any of the methods listed on <https://www.claudinec.net/hello/>
> 
> If you communicate only through Facebook or its cousins, I guess messages can go through [partner]? At least until I can convince her to join me in leaving this thing.
> 
> If [gaming GM A] and [gaming GM B] feel ready to take our game chats off Messenger then I can finally close this account for good!

> For socials, I prefer the Fediverse (Mastodon and friends). You can follow me at <https://aus.social/@claudinec> and my meta-guide to the Fediverse is at <https://www.claudinec.net/library/fediverse/>
> 
> Threads is technically on the Fediverse, but my server is one of many that will not federate with it â€“ more info at <https://fedipact.veganism.social/>
> 
> It looks like Facebook users are generally willing to settle for Bluesky as an alternative. You can follow me at ~~https://bsky.app/profile/claudinec.bsky.social~~[^bsky] if you must, but again, I'm more at home in the Fediverse.

And within half an hour, my GM friends came through! We're moving all game chats to Discord which we were already using for in-game voice calls. And it prompted more ideas for documentation in my [library](/library):

> (Maybe I will also add to my "library guides": "Why Discord is better than Messenger for threaded discussions" and "Why wikis [and wiki-like systems e.g. LegendKeeper] are better than Discord for knowledge sharing")
