I've made a few not-very-major changes here. <!--more--> I've changed the Hugo theme from [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) to [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). Terminal had been archived, and although it was still usable, I went looking for a theme that offered a little more customisation as well as light and dark options.

I've been considering different kinds of non-blog writing I might want to add as I've been reading up on the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movement. I've fleshed out my [About](/about) page, added another page listing [the technology I use](/uses), and have a few other preliminary ideas.

I'm trying to adjust my writing-in-public mindset &ndash; a blog post doesn't have to be more than a couple of sentences long. That might motivate me to post more often.
