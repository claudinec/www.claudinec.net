I love my [day job](https://queerarchives.org.au/about-us/) but I keep forgetting that rest is good for my mental and physical health. (At my age, you'd think I would have internalised this by now.) I'm taking a week off with ***NO PLANS!*** I've moved my synthesisers from my office floor onto my desk. Maybe I'll play with them, maybe I won't. Maybe I'll tinker with this website some more, maybe I won't. Maybe I'll make good progress reading *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism*, maybe I won't! What I definitely won't be doing is checking my to-do list every thirty minutes. How liberating.
