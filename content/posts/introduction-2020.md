title: A new introduction for 2020
---

I'm about to meet a lot of new people in my Information Management
course and online, so here's a bit about myself, 2020 version.

As a young Generation Xer (a 'Xennial'?) I have grown up with modern
society's transition from lifelong careers to multiple careers. I first
enrolled in the Master of Information Management at RMIT in 1999 when I
was working as a library officer at the City of Boroondara, but was
lured away by a career in public health and research data management. I
eventually realised that working solely with science, technology, and
data, while motivated by good, was not feeding my literary and
humanistic background, so I moved to a data management and web
development role with a medical historian and discovered the new field
of digital humanities. After a few years I found myself tired of the
challenges of working in a technical ('professional') role in an
academic environment and moved to technology consulting, primarily
working in web development, data management, and digital strategy for
non-profit organisations and creative individuals.

I've burned out multiple times in my career and, while I don't expect
any career change to be a panacea, I'm wagering the next few years or
decades of my life on the hope that the GLAMR field in 2020 will provide
the intellectual stimulation that will both draw on my technical
experience and feed my interests in literature, history, and the
humanities. I'm planning to continue reflecting on issues related to my study
and work on this blog and on Mastodon at
