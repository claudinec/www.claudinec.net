I have more computers than a regular person but not as many as a dedicated '[homelabber](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homelab)'. I run two always-on servers: a Mac Mini for [ArchiveBox](https://archivebox.io/) and for [filtering email](https://c-command.com/spamsieve/help/setting-up-a-spam-filte) with [SpamSieve](https://c-command.com/spamsieve/), and a Raspberry Pi git server running [gitolite](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html).

I'm currently catsitting for a few weeks. I take the Raspberry Pi with me on trips/catsits of more than a few days so my other devices can synchronise their git repositories without too much lag. I've also brought my MacBook as work at `$DAYJOB` will resume while I'm still here.

All my devices are connected to each other within a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) virtual private network. Yesterday I needed to resetart the ArchiveBox Docker container on the Mac Mini, which I did by logging in to the Mac Mini from my MacBook over [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC).

[My first computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) had 64 kilobytes of RAM and no disk storage. Any data or software apart from the operating system had to be loaded into memory from a [cassette tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette) or cartridge, though it was also possible to spend big bucks for an [external hard drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64_peripherals#Hard_drives). Some time in my last two years of high school, we got a modem that could connect our household to a pre-internet BBS/network. On days like yesterday, I stop to marvel at how far technology has advanced within my own lifetime.
