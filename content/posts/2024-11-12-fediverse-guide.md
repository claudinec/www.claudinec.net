Another mass migration from a certain micro-blogging hellsite to better alternatives is underway, and some of us on Mastodon and its cousins are trying to make Mastodon and the Fediverse more friendly and welcoming to newcomers. I have started a small [guide to the Fediverse](/library/fediverse) – at this stage, really just a guide to better guides that others have created, and a list of some of the friendly Mastodon servers that a newcomer might want to join.

This has also been an opportunity for me to finally set up a new section of this website for resource-style content rather than chronological blog posts – so, for example, I can continue updating my Fediverse meta-guide with more links, and keep it in a pinned post on my Mastodon timeline. Some in the IndieWeb community are fond of metaphors like ['digital garden'](https://indieweb.org/digital_garden) or ['commonplace book'](https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book) for this kind of resource, but I am a terrible gardener and the idea of a single book feels limiting, so I've settled on the [**Library**](/library) metaphor for mine.
