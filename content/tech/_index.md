I provide technology services and consulting for progressive organisations and creative individuals in Australia.

I work with clients to determine and implement the solutions that meet their needs and budget, covering areas such as:

- Overall digital strategy
- Building, extending, and maintaining websites using a content management system ([WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) or [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) 7) and custom extensions and plugins
- Setting up systems to manage confidential member and supporter data in a contact relationship manager ([CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/) or [NationBuilder](https://nationbuilder.com/))
- Integrating websites with external services
- Engaging and collaborating with content strategists, social media strategists, graphic designers, and videographers

Past clients have included:

- The [Victorian Greens](https://greens.org.au/vic), and federal and state Greens MPs and candidates in Melbourne, Richmond, and Brunswick

- Community organisations and NGOs including the [Centre for Multicultural Youth](https://www.cmy.net.au/), the [Australian Student Christian Movement](https://ascm.org.au/), the Uniting Church (Victoria and Tasmania) Justice and International Mission Unit, and the [Women's Electoral Lobby](https://www.wel.org.au/)
