## How to refer to me

<div id="h-card" class="h-card">
<p>Hi, I'm <span class="p-name"><span class="p-given-name">Claudine</span> <span class="p-family-name">Chionh</span></span>.
My pronouns are <a class="u-pronoun" href="https://pronouns.within.lgbt/she/her">she/her/hers</a>.
My family name is pronounced (from the Hokkien) <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/蔣#Pronunciation_1">/t͡ɕiɔŋ⁵³/</a> ("Chiong") but I'll answer to anything that comes close. "Chionh" is a bad romanisation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C7%8Eng_(surname)">Jiǎng (蒋)</a> – family lore says that the misspelling was introduced by a British colonial clerk.

## About me

When I was a child I sometimes made my own [library cards and envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_card#Borrowing_cards) to stick in my own books. My first media appearance was at the age of six when my freelance-journalist mother wrote about my reading habits and book collection as inspiration for a national children-should-read-more-books campaign in Singapore. I got my first home computer and wrote my first programs at the age of ten or thereabouts, in the 1980s. And I started (but did not finish) a computer science degree in 1994 at the dawn of Web 1.0.

I worked "in tech" for about fifteen years but in 2019 I was looking for more balance between technology and the humanities and between work and "life". I retrained in Information Management during the world's longest lockdowns and now work for the [Australian Queer Archives](https://queerarchives.org.au/) as I explore what a midlife GLAMRous career change might look like. I'm still wrangling spreadsheets at work but I appreciate not having my entire work day occupied with technology problems. It's even enabled me to rediscover the fun of programming as a hobby.

I live and work on the lands of the [Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung](https://www.wurundjeri.com.au/) and Yalukit-willam (Boonwurrung) peoples in what is commonly known as Melbourne, Australia. If you're in the same part of the world, you can learn more about [identifying traditional owners](https://aiatsis.gov.au/whose-country) and view a general [map](https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/map-indigenous-australia) on the AIATSIS website.
