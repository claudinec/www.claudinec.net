## Professional

My career has traced converging threads that first appeared in
childhood, when I spent most of my free time reading books and making
zines, learning computer programming and building databases. I have
worked in a variety of roles in data management, web development, and
digital humanities, always advocating for scientifically rigorous
perspectives in the arts and humanities and humane approaches to
computing and technology. I am committed to the principles of free and
open source software, and in the past have helped lead the Melbourne
chapter of [LinuxChix](https://www.linuxchix.org/) and [Linux Users of
Victoria](https://luv.asn.au/). In 2020 I will begin studying
Information Management at RMIT University. While I am open to new career
directions in archives, libraries, or digital humanities, I am
particularly interested in learning about, and practising, digital
preservation in a climate of planned obsolescence and the possible
impending end of life as we know it.

## Personal

## The professional is personal

And political, too.
